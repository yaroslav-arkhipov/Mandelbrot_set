This program is the result of performance experiments in python. Using standard tools, the program had very low performance (at the level of 5 fps). When using the Numba library, performance increased tenfold (up to 100-120 fps). Which clearly shows the practical value of this library. The following libraries must be installed for the program to work:
-pygame
-numpy
-numba
